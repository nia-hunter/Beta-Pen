This is the user manual for the Geant4 simulation in a way
since this is set up to be fairly modular it can be easily
modified by the user.

Firstly, the program will build with the name N_G_Det and
can be used as in either way 1 or 2

1.

./N_G_Det

this will cause an interactive instance, with default being OpenGL
this can be altered in vis.mac, other optins such as the verbose
level is delt with in init_vis.mac as well as the default particle
source

2.

./N_G_Det macro.mac

This will cause the simulation to start in batch mode, executing
what is in the macro.

In each case, two files will be produced, one is G4History.macro
this is, as indicated, this shows the command history. The other
file is N_G_Det.root, this is a root file containing the measured
parameters.

Several macros are provided in the install, AmBe.mac is a AmBe
source using data from papers, Beam.mac is a standard beam, with
662keV gammas, but can be changed as nessesery. The other macros
are used in setup of the interactive session and can be changed
as needed, with only vis.mac usually being of concern. init_vis.mac
can be changed to give different default source.

If you are making macros, it is needed to include the line
/run/initialize as I have made it possible to change engine
settings that are not possible to change after inintialization,
this is only a small caveat, for a drastic change in power of
the macros.

It is possible to change the array size and pixel pitch in the
DetectorConstruction.cc.
This is done by changing the varibles at the top, it is imperitive
to change this at the top as they are used at a file scope
the variables in question are:
SiPM_n
SiPM_m
SiPM_pitch
SiPM_sep

these are the n and m values and the ptich and seperation
the pitch and sepeartion are halfed, as always in geant4
ie 3mm=1.5mm entered, and the units are mm.

The array is set to always be centered at (0,0,0) in the simulation
and the thickness is 0.6mm. In this version they are made of
perspex for complicated reasons, but this will be fixed in a later
build. If it really irratates, it is a easy fix.

If you need other measurements, this will require changes to
HistoManager, EventAction and Stepping Action

Anything put in the fScint placement will be considered the
scintillator and energy deposited in it will be tracked,
the scintillation light from any scintillator will be added
to one global value currently(easily changed), this was done
as only one scintillator or array is usually used.

Anything with the SiPM_log logical volume will be considered
the detector; position, time and photons will be extracted as
one detector. This can be made to be read out individually
but causes increased runtimes.

I think that is about it.

Happy Simulating
